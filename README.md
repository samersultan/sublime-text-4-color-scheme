# Tubster Color Scheme (Modified) - Sublime Text 4


Modified version of the tubster color scheme for <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 3</a>. Ported from my <a href="https://github.com/samersultan/sublime-text-2-color-scheme">sublime text 2 tubster modded theme</a>. An easy to read, high contast dark theme, that helps to reduce eye strain.
